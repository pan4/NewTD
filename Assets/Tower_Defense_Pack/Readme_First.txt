There is an example capture image of "Build Settings" (Build_Settings_Example.jpg).

There is more info and contact-info in "/Tutorials_and_Info" sub-folder.

Note: If you do not add the layers and the scenes in Build Settings, the code will not work correctly.
Note: If you see the "hand" mouse cursor in an error place into the screen (Only editor), please stop and play again or put "scene window" and "game window" on a same TV screen, play and now you can put on place that you want.
          -It usually occurs when the "scene window" and "game window" are in different TV screens.
